User Data: The Bot may collect user data such as Discord usernames, IDs, and server-related information when commands are executed.
Roblox Data: For certain commands or features, the Bot may collect publicly available Roblox data, such as your Roblox username, game statistics, and game activity. No personal or private Roblox account information is collected without your consent.
Message Data: The Bot may temporarily store messages or command responses, but this data is not retained long-term or shared with third parties.
3. How We Use the Information

To Provide Services: The Bot uses the collected data to execute the commands you request, such as retrieving Roblox game statistics, notifications for events, and other features related to Roblox.
Improving the Bot: We may use aggregated and anonymized data to improve the functionality and performance of the Bot.
Support and Troubleshooting: In the event of an issue, we may use the data to identify and fix problems related to the Bot’s performance.
4. Data Retention and Deletion
Temporary Data: Most data collected by the Bot, such as command usage and Roblox-related statistics, is only stored temporarily and is cleared shortly after use.
No Long-Term Storage: We do not store personal data long-term. All user-related data is either cleared at the end of a session or after fulfilling the user’s request.
User Requests: If you wish to have your data removed, please contact us at [https://discord.gg/e7DUUTuGM4], and we will ensure that your data is deleted as required.
5. Data Sharing and Disclosure

6. Security
We are committed to maintaining the security and integrity of user data. We use reasonable technical measures to protect the data processed by the Bot. However, please note that no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

7. Children’s Privacy
The Bot is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 without parental consent. If we learn that we have collected such data, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.
